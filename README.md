# Hackathon-Web-Development-Energy-ESG-Project

This repository contains the files for a weekend Hackathon project I completed in partnership with Katy Smith and Lixy Cyril at the AthenaHacks 2023 Hackathon. We won second place by developing a web application to influence customer behaviour at the CodeNode conference centre towards more environmentally sustainable practices. This project was designed to be included in RSVP forms for events at the conference centre, to interactively educate customers about how to reduce their carbon footprint while at the venue. [I developed the project Podcasts page](https://hackathon-energy-project.netlify.app/podcast), wrote and researched [the project content](https://hackathon-energy-project.netlify.app/) and developed [the six carbon cards on the project Carbon Calculator page](https://hackathon-energy-project.netlify.app/form). This was a women's only event - I highly enjoyed learning from and competing with these fantastic career women in tech, and would reccomend this to any of the women in my network.
