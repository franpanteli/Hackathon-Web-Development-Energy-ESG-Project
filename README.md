Project Abstract
</h1>
<p>
This repository contains the files for a Hackathon project I completed over 48 hours of coding, in partnership with Katy Smith and Lixy Cyril at the AthenaHacks 2023 Hackathon. We developed a web application, to alter customer behaviour at the CodeNode conference centre towards more evirovonmentally sustainable practices at its events. Our project won second place and was designed to be included in event RVP forms for events hosted at the conference centre, to educate customers about their carbon footprint before attending the event in an interactive way.
