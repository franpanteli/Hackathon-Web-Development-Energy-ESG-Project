Project Abstract

<p>
This repository contains the files for a weekend Hackathon project I completed in partnership with Katy Smith and Lixy Cyril at the AthenaHacks 2023 Hackathon for women. Our teamwork won second place, by developing a web application to influence customer behaviour at the CodeNode conference centre towards more environmentally sustainable practices. This project was designed to be included in RSVP forms for events at the conference centre, to interactively educate customers about how to reduce their carbon footprint while at the venue. The project is deployed at https://hackathon-energy-project.netlify.app/
