Project Abstract
</h1>
<p>
This repository contains the files for a weekend Hackathon project I completed in partnership with Katy Smith and Lixy Cyril at the AthenaHacks 2023 Hackathon for gender minorities in  technology. We won second place by developing a web application to influence customer behaviour at the CodeNode conference centre towards more environmentally sustainable practices. This project was designed to be included in RSVP forms for events at the conference centre, to interactively educate customers about how to reduce their carbon footprint while at the venue. [I developed the project podcasts page](https://hackathon-energy-project.netlify.app/podcast), wrote and researched [the content for the project in a separate file](https://hackathon-energy-project.netlify.app/) and developed [the six carbon cards on the project carbon calculator page](https://hackathon-energy-project.netlify.app/form). This was in May 2023, and I it was my first introduction to working with GitHub in teams, which I learnt from the other women I worked with over the weekend competition. My version of our project is deployed at https://hackathon-energy-project.netlify.app/
